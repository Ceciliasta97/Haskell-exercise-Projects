Running a Haskell project typically involves a few key steps:
1. setting up your environment and initialize a new project
2. compiling your project
3.  executing the compiled program.

(1) initialize new project: $ stack new my-project
    --Navigate to the Project Directory: cd my-project   (E.g. Project1)
(2) build your project: stack build
(3) run your roject: $ cd Project1
                     $ stack exec Project1-exe   
(4) if want to clean the stack : stack clean
